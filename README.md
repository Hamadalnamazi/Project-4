### The Libraries

The project was implemented using Anaconda distribution of Python 3.0. Moreover I have used the following python libraries:

1. Collections
2. Matplotlib
3. NLTK
4. NumPy
5. Pandas
6. Seaborn
7. Sklearn

### My Project Motivation

I was interested in exploring the AirBnB dataset for Seattle. I wanted to better understand the pricing trends and pricing prediction. Some of the questions that I have analyzed are:

Understand price increases/decreases by season and detect peak season in Seattle ?

what is the relation between neighborhoods , review and price how review and neighborhoods effect on price ?

Does accommodates make price higher and what is Top10 neighborhoods that accommodates effect in ?

### File Descriptions

The Jupyter notebook showcases the analysis done in order to explore the dataset, the data prepartion and wrangling as well as the building of prediction models in order to answer the questions above. The notebook contains markdown cells to help with documentation of the steps as well as to communicate findings based on each analysis.

For reference an HTML version of the notebook is also available.

Lastly, the seattle folder contains the dataset from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/seattle). It contains 3 files:

calendar.csv: calendar availability of listings and price
listings.csv: information about all the available listings
reviews.csv: listing reviews by the users

### Summary Of The Results
